# Smartwatch Companion App for Health Monitoring

A Flutter-based health monitoring app that integrates with a Bluetooth SDK to fetch real-time data like heart rate and step count. The app includes Firebase Authentication, a Dashboard for health data, a History screen for past records, and a Settings screen for Bluetooth management.

## Features
- **Firebase Authentication**: User login via Google Sign-In or Email/Password.
- **Dashboard**: Displays real-time health data (heart rate, step count).
- **History Screen**: Shows past health records stored in Firestore.
- **Settings Screen**: Manages Bluetooth connection and app preferences.
- **Mock Bluetooth SDK**: Simulates health data fetching with updates every 10 seconds.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-monitoring-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd health-monitoring-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Set up Firebase in your project:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Add Firebase for Android/iOS following official Firebase documentation.
   - Download the `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and place it in the respective directory.

5. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Backend
- **Firestore**: User profiles and health records are stored in Firestore.
- **API Endpoints**: Use Firebase Functions or Node.js to handle backend tasks (if applicable).

## Known Issues
- Data syncing with the backend is still in progress.
- Bluetooth communication is being developed.

## Future Improvements
- Implement data syncing when the app is online.
- Complete Bluetooth functionality for device connection and health data fetching.
